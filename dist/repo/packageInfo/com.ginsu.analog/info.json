  "description": "If you prefer classy analog clocks and are bored of iOS's default digital clock, then Analog for you! Analog adds a fully customisable analog clock to the lock screen with the following features:\n\n - Clock face and clock hand theming (themers can design their own clock themes and put them up for download somewhere).\n\n- Customisable date complication.\n\n- A lock status indicator for devices with face id.\n\n- A digital time complication.\n\n- A wallpaper colour detection.\n\n- Supports translations.\n\n- And many more customisable options\n\nFor theme creators:\n\n- Custom clock faces:\nCustom clock faces should be **500x500px** '.png' files named 'Face.png'. You should make a folder with the name of your theme, then place your 'Face.png' inside. You can then place the folder you created in this directory `/Library/Application Support/Analog/Faces/`.\n\nCustom clock hands:\nThere is 4 main images needed to create a set of clock hands: `Center.png, Seconds.png, Hour.png, Minute.png`. The dimensions for the files are as follows:\n\n- Center.png = 25x25px\n- Seconds.png = 16x120px\n- Hour.png = 16x101px\n- Minute.Png = 16x120px\n\nSimilarly to custom clock faces, you need to create a folder with the name of your theme, then place those images inside the folder. After that, you can place the folder in the directory: `/Library/Application Support/Analog/Hands/`.",
