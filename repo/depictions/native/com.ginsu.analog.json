Analog adds a fully customisable analog clock to the Lock Screen with the following features:\n\n- Clock face and clock hand theming (Themers can design their own clock themes and put them up for download somewhere).\n- Customisable date complication.\n- A lock status indicator for devices with Face-ID.\n- A digital time complication.\n- Wallpaper colour detection.\n- upports translations.\n- And many more customisable options!\n\nFor Theme creators:\n\nCustom clock faces:\nCustom clock faces should be 500x500px '.png' files named 'Face.png'. You should make a folder with the name of your theme, then place your 'Face.png' inside. You can then place the folder you created in this directory '\/Library\/Application Support\/Analog\/Faces\/'.\n\nCustom clock hands:\nThere is 4 main images needed to create a set of clock hands: 'Center.png, Seconds.png, Hour.png, Minute.png'. The dimensions for the files are as follows:\n\n- Center.png = 25x25px\n- Seconds.png = 16x120px\n- Hour.png = 16x101px\n- Minute.png = 16x120px\n\nSimilarly to custom clock faces, you need to create a folder with the name of your theme, then place those images inside the folder. After that, you can place the folder in the directory: '\/Library\/Application Support\/Analog\/Hands\/'."},{"class":"DepictionSeparatorView"},{"title":"Extra information","class":"DepictionHeaderView"},{"text":"1.1","class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","text":"Free","title":"Price"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","text":"Ginsu","title":"Developer"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","action":"https:\/\/ginsu.dev\/repo\/depictions\/index.html?packageId=com.ginsu.analog","title":"View web depiction"}],"tabname":"Details"},{"class":"DepictionStackView","tabname":"Changes","views":[{"class":"DepictionLayerView","views":[{"useBoldText":true,"class":"DepictionSubheaderView","alignment":0,"title":"1.1"},{"class":"DepictionSubheaderView","alignment":2,"title":"2023-04-15"}]},{"markdown":"- Transitioned to libgscommon to handle most preference-related stuff for better maintenance.","useSpacing":true,"class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView","spacing":12}]},{"class":"DepictionStackView","tabname":"Contact","views":[{"action":"https:\/\/discord.gg\/BhdUyCbgkZ","class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Discord"},{"action":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GinsuDev","class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Twitter"}]}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
