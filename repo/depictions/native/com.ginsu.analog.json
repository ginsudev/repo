Analog adds a fully customisable analog clock to the Lock Screen with the following features:\n\n- Clock face and clock hand theming (Themers can design their own clock themes and put them up for download somewhere).\n- Customisable date complication.\n- A lock status indicator for devices with Face-ID.\n- A digital time complication.\n- Wallpaper colour detection.\n- upports translations.\n- And many more customisable options!\n\nFor Theme creators:\n\nCustom clock faces:\nCustom clock faces should be 500x500px '.png' files named 'Face.png'. You should make a folder with the name of your theme, then place your 'Face.png' inside. You can then place the folder you created in this directory '\/Library\/Application Support\/Analog\/Faces\/'.\n\nCustom clock hands:\nThere is 4 main images needed to create a set of clock hands: 'Center.png, Seconds.png, Hour.png, Minute.png'. The dimensions for the files are as follows:\n\n- Center.png = 25x25px\n- Seconds.png = 16x120px\n- Hour.png = 16x101px\n- Minute.png = 16x120px\n\nSimilarly to custom clock faces, you need to create a folder with the name of your theme, then place those images inside the folder. After that, you can place the folder in the directory: '\/Library\/Application Support\/Analog\/Hands\/'.","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSeparatorView"},{"title":"Extra information","class":"DepictionHeaderView"},{"title":"Version","text":"2.0","class":"DepictionTableTextView"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","text":"Free","title":"Price"},{"text":"Ginsu","title":"Developer","class":"DepictionTableTextView"},{"action":"https:\/\/ginsu.dev\/repo\/depictions\/index.html?packageId=com.ginsu.analog","title":"View web depiction","class":"DepictionTableButtonView"}],"tabname":"Details","class":"DepictionStackView"},{"views":[{"views":[{"alignment":0,"title":"2.0","class":"DepictionSubheaderView","useBoldText":true},{"alignment":2,"class":"DepictionSubheaderView","title":"2025-06-29"}],"class":"DepictionLayerView"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"Support iOS 16.
